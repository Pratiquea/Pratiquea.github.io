>Hey! I'm a Graduate Student pursuing Masters of Engineering in Robotics at the University of Maryland, College Park (UMD). I am a member of the Perception and Robotics Group (PRG), advised by Prof. Yiannis Aloimonos and Dr. Cornelia Fermuller. PRG is associated with the University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies (UMIACS) and Autonomy, Robotics and Cognition Lab (ARC). My research interest lie in improving vision-based navigational capabilities of autonomous systems especially aerial robots using traditional and deep learning.

I'm originally from Delhi, India. Prior to joining UMD, I worked with as a Research Associate with Dr P.B. Sujit and Dr Sanjit kaul on self driving car in Indian Urban scenrio at IIIT-Delhi. Before that, I did my Bachelors of Technology in Electrical Engineering at Bharati Vidyapeeth's College of Engineering(BVP), GGSIPU. At BVP, I worked with Asst. Prof. Gargi Mishra on legged robots.

In my spare time I like to practice guitar and trek.
